# Bloodskin

**Bloodskin** is "mental poker": there are no cards, so all players have equal chances - your victory depends only on your ability to persuade other people.

## Rules

* There are 5 players at the table.
* Each player needs to bet on "blood" or "skin" ("red" or "black").
* Let's say 3 players bet on "blood", 2 players bet on "skin". In this case, 3 players divide the money of the 2 players (those who bet on "blood" divide the money of those who bet on "skin") 

Notes:
* You can communicate with other players: for example, you can try to persuade them to make the same bet.
* However, the bets are hidden until the end of the round.
* Each player bets the same amount of money.
* All players join the game for at least 7 rounds (the more the better).
* The winnings are split proportionately (in 3-2 situation, each winner gets 2/3, in 4-1 situation, each winner gets 1/4)
* Each player has 1 minute to speak before he makes a bet.
* The discussion starts with the next player each round. For example, on round 1 the discussion starts with player 1, on round 2 it starts with player 2, etc (in a circular loop)

## Ideas

* Allow to implement bots (invest in them).
